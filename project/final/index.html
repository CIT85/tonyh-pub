            <h2>How I Became a 49ers Fan</h2>
            <p>I became a 49ers fan in 2010, thanks to the influence of family and friends. Watching games together has created lasting memories and helped me connect with the "Faithful" fan base.</p>
                <h3>Favorite Game</h3>
                <p>One of my most memorable games was the 2013 Super Bowl, the San Francisco 49ers vs Baltimore Ravens.</p>
                <p>It was amazing to see the 49ers play in the Super Bowl even though they did not get the win. Watching the Super Bowl yearly with friends and family has since became a yearly thing for me.</p>
